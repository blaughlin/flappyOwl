**FLAPPY OWL**

My version of flappy bird, inspired by Harvard's CS50 game course. I converted base code from Lua to Javascript and implemented several new features and changed the design. To play press enter or mouse click in. To move up use the space bar or mouse click. Press the p key to pause the game.
